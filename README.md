# hangman-python

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Hangman in Python. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list and prompts the user to guess letters in the word. If the user guesses a correct letter, it will be revealed in the word. If the user guesses an incorrect letter, the number of tries left will decrease. The game ends when the user correctly guesses all letters in the word or runs out of tries. The user can also see the letters they already guessed, if any.

## How to play

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Run the hangman.py file using python
3. Follow the prompts to guess letters in the word
4. If you guess all letters correctly before running out of tries, you win!

## Customizing the game

You can customize the game by editing the list of words in the program. Simply replace the current list of words with your own list of words.

## Note

This is just a simple implementation of the game, you can make it more advance by adding more features like adding different level of difficulty, score board, etc.
